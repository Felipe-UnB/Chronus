''Some comments:
''I had a little problem because a was not defined as a string. So, when I tried to
''call it in SheetExists function a ByRef argument type mismatch occurred. Read the
''solution below:
''I suspect you haven't set up last_name properly in the caller.
''With the statement Worksheets(data_sheet).Range("C2").Value = ProcessString(last_name)
''this will only work if last_name is a string, i.e.
''Dim last_name as String appears in the caller somewhere.
''The reason for this is that VBA passes in variables by reference by default which means
''that the data types have to match exactly between caller and callee.
''Two fixes:
''1) Change your function to Public Function ProcessString(ByVal input_string As String) As String
''2) put Dim last_name As String in the caller before you use it.
''(1) works because for ByVal, a copy of input_string is taken when passing to the function which
''will coerce it into the correct data type. It also leads to better program stability since the
''function cannot modify the variable in the caller.

    'This beautiful code below aws a great suggestion from Steve Jorgensen in
    'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4873182/sorting-a-multidimensionnal-array-in-vba
    'http://stackoverflow.com/a/4955848/2449724
    'Below there is a copy of Steve's comment about it.
    'The hard part is that VBA provides no straightforward way to swap rows in a 2D array.
    'For each swap, you're going to have to loop over 5 elements and swap each one, which
    'will be very inefficient. I'm guessing that a 2D array is really not what you should
    'be using anyway though. Does each column have a specific meaning? If so, should you
    'not be using an array of a user-defined type, or an array of objects that are instances
    'of a class module? Even if the 5 columns don't have specific meanings, you could still
    'do this, but define the UDT or class module to have just a single member that is a 5-element
    'array.
    'For the sort algorithm itself, I would use a plain ol' Insertion Sort. 1000 items is
    'actually not that big, and you probably won't notice the difference between an Insertion
    'Sort and Quick Sort, so long as we've made sure that each swap will not be too slow. If
    'you do use a Quick Sort, you'll need to code it carefully to make sure you won't run out
    'of stack space, which can be done, but it's complicated, and Quick Sort is tricky enough
    'already.
    
    'So assuming you use an array of UDTs, and assuming the UDT contains variants named Field1
    'through Field5, and assuming we want to sort on Field2 (for example), then the code might
    'look something like this...
    
    
    
    'The code below is mostly Steve's code with minor differences. I defined a UDT called
    'IDsTimesDifference which is used in this code.
